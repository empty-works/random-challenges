/* Implement a URL shortener with the following methods:
 *
 * - shorten(url), which shortens the url into a 
 *   six-character alphanumeric string, such as 
 *   zlg6wl.
 * - restore(short), which expands the shortened 
 *   string into the original url. If no such 
 *   shortened string exists, return null.
 *
 * Hint: what if we enter the same URL twice?
